<b>About me</b>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell. My current research for my qualifying paper investigates agreement attraction effects in Spanish-English codeswitching, using both online and offline measures. I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/compling/">Cornell Computational Linguistics Lab.</a> 

When I'm not studying linguistics, you can find me reading Discword novels, rock climbing, racing triathlons, and recently even teaching sea kayaking with Cornell Outdoor Education.

<b>Research interests:</b> syntax/morphosyntax, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, bilingualism, codeswitching
